            <p>My quantitative background is in computational neuroscience. During my days as a
            neuroscientist, I spent most of my time analyzing time series data, so I'll always have a 
            soft spot in my heart for forecasting models.
            <br>
            <br>
            Nowadays, I like to apply my skillset more widely. Here are some topics I'm interested in:
            <ul>
              <li>I'm obsessed with learning more about knowledge graphs.</li>
              <li>Maps. Maps of humans, of trees, of butterfly migrations, of limestone, of clown attacks, etc.</li>
              <li>I'm passionate about applying my skillset to the healthcare and e-learning industries.</li>
              <li>I have a background in human factors, so I care deeply about usability and explainability in AI.</li>
              <li>I love a good UI.</li>
            </ul>

            <a href="https://github.com/danielkentwood/sugartime">SugarTime</a>
            <p>The SugarTime package is a set of tools to model the effects of carbohydrates and 
              insulin on blood glucose dynamics. The goal of these tools is to learn how a diabetic's 
              blood glucose responds to food and to insulin. After it has learned this, the patient 
              can provide the timing and amount of carbs they plan on eating, and the model will 
              offer a best guess as to which insulin dosage will keep their blood glucose within 
              an optimal range.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/danielkentwood/SearchMoDB">SearchMo</a>
            <p>This started off as an exploration of my Mormon roots. It is currently an app that 
              provides N-Gram frequency search functionality for a corpus of sermons and lessons 
              from LDS church leadership. It covers from the mid 1800s to today. I have plans to 
              expand into other religions/traditions.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/danielkentwood/DuraScrape">DuraScrape</a>
            <p>DuraScrape is a web crawler that scrapes open-access journal articles from academic
              journal websites and saves them in a SQL database.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/danielkentwood/Countdown">Countdown</a>
            <p>This is currently a quick EDA of the mortality dataset at NBER. The short-term goal 
              is to provide a clean interface to the dataset, allowing users to input demographic 
              features (e.g., race, education, sex, marital status, etc.), and then see when someone 
              with those demographic features is most likely to die.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/danielkentwood/NERF">NERF:</br>Nonlinear Estimation of Receptive Fields</a>
            <p>This is currently a repository of MATLAB and python code for preprocessing and analysis of behavioral 
              and neural timeseries data. Beyond I/O, cleaning, and basic plotting functions, it 
              specifically provides tools for inferring the spatiotemporal preferences of visually 
              responsive neurons.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/danielkentwood/vis3DConnect">vis3DConnect</a>
            <p>Vis3DConnect is a python toolset for 3D visualization of brain connectivity data. 
              It allows the user to select neural tracing experiments from the Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas 
              at the Allen Institute, and to visualize them in a 3D glass brain with an interface that allows 
              rotation, zooming, etc.</p>
