            Me: Since you asked, here is my philosophy on science in industry. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Despite our insatiable curiosity 
            about the world, we humans come with some evolutionary baggage that 
            makes it hard to learn about <i>the</i> world instead of <i>our individual</i> world. In other 
            words, the practice of science is entangled with all of the other practical needs and drives
            that motivate human experience. Competition. Vanity. A distaste for ambiguity. The need to belong.
            This list of existential funhouse mirrors is long. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Science, in its ideal form, is a set of practices and cognitive prostheses that attempt
            to de-humanize our thinking. In an important sense, we want our instruments to intervene into
            brute matter and energy in ways that bypass our biases. And we want the same of the algorithms we 
            use to make sense of the data that our instruments give us. 
            <br>
            <br>
            A data scientist should be a scientist first and foremost. There should be curiosity and creative
            hypotheses, because we are human. But there should be an obsessive effort to test those hypotheses 
            in ways that have nothing to do with us or our projects. And then, when the data have spoken, we

            <a href="https://github.com/danielkentwood/sugartime">SugarTime</a>
            <p>The SugarTime package is a set of tools to model the effects of carbohydrates and 
              insulin on blood glucose dynamics. The goal of these tools is to learn how a diabetic's 
              blood glucose responds to food and to insulin. After it has learned this, the patient 
              can provide the timing and amount of carbs they plan on eating, and the model will 
              offer a best guess as to which insulin dosage will keep their blood glucose within 
              an optimal range.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/danielkentwood/SearchMoDB">SearchMo</a>
            <p>This started off as an exploration of my Mormon roots. It is currently an app that 
              provides N-Gram frequency search functionality for a corpus of sermons and lessons 
              from LDS church leadership. It covers from the mid 1800s to today. I have plans to 
              expand into other religions/traditions.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/danielkentwood/DuraScrape">DuraScrape</a>
            <p>DuraScrape is a web crawler that scrapes open-access journal articles from academic
              journal websites and saves them in a SQL database.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/danielkentwood/Countdown">Countdown</a>
            <p>This is currently a quick EDA of the mortality dataset at NBER. The short-term goal 
              is to provide a clean interface to the dataset, allowing users to input demographic 
              features (e.g., race, education, sex, marital status, etc.), and then see when someone 
              with those demographic features is most likely to die.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/danielkentwood/NERF">NERF:</br>Nonlinear Estimation of Receptive Fields</a>
            <p>This is currently a repository of MATLAB and python code for preprocessing and analysis of behavioral 
              and neural timeseries data. Beyond I/O, cleaning, and basic plotting functions, it 
              specifically provides tools for inferring the spatiotemporal preferences of visually 
              responsive neurons.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/danielkentwood/vis3DConnect">vis3DConnect</a>
            <p>Vis3DConnect is a python toolset for 3D visualization of brain connectivity data. 
              It allows the user to select neural tracing experiments from the Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas 
              at the Allen Institute, and to visualize them in a 3D glass brain with an interface that allows 
              rotation, zooming, etc.</p>
